#DESCRIPTION:This project demonstrates how to consume a REST API using Java, handle HTTP requests, parse JSON responses, and display structured data. It is an excellent example of how Java applications can integrate with real-world APIs to provide useful functionalities.APIs (Application Programming Interfaces) are essential for integrating different systems and fetching real-time data. In this project, we develop a Java application that consumes the OpenWeatherMap REST API to fetch weather data for a given city. The application retrieves temperature, humidity, and weather conditions and displays them in a structured format.Eclipse widely used Java IDE with plugin support.
